#Minimum landing altitude.
#When the ballon is falling below this altitude the landing signal
#will be sent to the camera and the buzzer will start to beep.

#When the baloon will rise abose this altitude, the STRAOSPHERE signal will be
#sent to the camera.

#Ascent/discent rates used to check if the baloon is going up or down.
#The ballon is going up if the ascent rate is greater than rate_up and is
#going down if the descent rate is lower than rate_down.
#If the ascent rate is lower than rate_up but higher than rate_down,
#the baloon is considered as hovering (or grounded if the altitude is lower
than ground_alt).
